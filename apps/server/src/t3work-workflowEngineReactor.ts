/**
 * The workflow-engine resume reactor (Epic 25 §Host wiring) — the one genuinely new
 * production mechanism. It watches orchestration domain events and turns a completed agent
 * turn / a user reply into `appendResolvedEntry` + `resumeWorkflow`, driving a parked run
 * forward.
 *
 * For each `thread.message-sent` event it reads the pending ask the workflow registered for
 * that thread:
 *   • a final assistant message (`role: "assistant"`, `streaming: false`) resolves a
 *     `thread.turn` (an `askAgent` / `agent` call) with the assistant text;
 *   • a user message resolves a `user.input` (an `askUser` call) with the user's text.
 * A message that does not match the pending ask's kind (e.g. the user-role prompt the engine
 * itself dispatched to start a turn) is left pending so the right event still resolves it.
 *
 * ── Assembling the assistant reply ──────────────────────────────────────────
 * The final `streaming: false` assistant `thread.message-sent` is only a "this message is
 * complete" marker: its `text` is the empty string (see the decider's
 * `thread.message.assistant.complete` case + `ProviderRuntimeIngestion.finalizeAssistantMessage`).
 * The assistant's actual text arrives in the `streaming: true` delta events that precede it
 * (one full-text delta in buffered mode, many chunks in streaming mode), all sharing the
 * `messageId`. So the reactor accumulates assistant deltas per `messageId` while a turn is
 * awaited on that thread, then resolves the turn with the assembled text when the
 * `streaming: false` marker lands. Reading `event.payload.text` off the final event directly
 * would resolve every agent turn with `""` — the interactive model would silently not work.
 *
 * Events are drained through a single worker so resumes never interleave: `resume` awaits the
 * replay to its next suspension (which re-registers the new pending ask) before the next event
 * is processed.
