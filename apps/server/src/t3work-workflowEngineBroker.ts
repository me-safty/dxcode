/**
 * The orchestration-backed {@link MessageBroker} for the workflow engine (Epic 25 §Host
 * wiring). Each thread verb fired by a workflow body maps onto one orchestration command:
 *
 *   • thread.create  → dispatch(thread.create)        — make the spawned thread.
 *   • thread.turn    → dispatch(thread.turn.start)     — start an agent turn; record a pending
 *                       ask so the reactor can resolve it when the turn completes.
 *   • thread.message → dispatch(thread.message.upsert) — post a one-way message (no turn).
 *   • user.input     → dispatch(thread.message.upsert, role system) — request user input; record
 *                       a pending ask resolved when the user replies.
 *
 * The broker is created per run, so it carries the run's id, project, and model selection.
 * Dispatches are chained on a single tail promise: `thread.create` is fired floating by the
 * SDK's one-way `sendOneWay`, so chaining guarantees the create lands before the `thread.turn`
 * it precedes (turn-on-a-missing-thread would otherwise race).
