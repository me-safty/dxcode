/**
 * Launches a recipe's `.workflow.ts` through the durable engine (Epic 25 §Host wiring) — the
 * repointed replacement for the deleted step-union launch path.
 *
 * It builds the per-run orchestration broker, registers a `resume` closure (so the reactor can
 * drive the run forward when a turn completes or the user replies), then calls
 * `startWorkflow`. A run that fires an ask verb returns a `SuspendedResult` and is parked; the
 * registry keeps its `resume` alive until the reply lands. A completed run is unregistered.
 *
 * ── Durability (Epic 25 §Open question 2) ────────────────────────────────────
 * Two optional seams make a parked run survive a restart, and the {@link createWorkflowRunController}
 * that wires them is shared with boot rehydration so a restored run behaves identically:
 *   • `store` — a {@link JournalStore} (the host's SQLite store). Threaded into startWorkflow /
 *     resumeWorkflow / appendResolvedEntry so the journal is DB-backed, not on local disk.
 *   • `lifecycle` — a {@link WorkflowRunLifecycle} write-through to `workflow_runs`: `recordRunning`
 *     on launch, `recordSuspended` when an ask parks the run (driven by the broker, which knows
 *     the pending thread/correlation/kind), `recordCompleted`/`recordFailed` on settle. The
 *     in-memory registry stays the reactor's hot index; the DB is the source of truth a boot
 *     rehydration reads to rebuild this controller.
 * Both default to undefined — the SDK-style fs path (and the launch test) run unchanged.
 *
 * The Promise/Effect bridge: orchestration commands run via the injected `dispatch`, so the
 * Promise-based engine can drive the Effect-based host. `resume` re-enters `resumeWorkflow`,
 * which replays journaled asks (NOT re-firing the broker) and only fires past the frontier.
