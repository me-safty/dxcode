// @effect-diagnostics globalTimers:off -- the scheduler is the one component that bridges real
// wall-clock time to the engine: it owns a single host timer (injectable for tests) armed for
// the soonest deadline, not an Effect fiber sleep. Workflow bodies still read the journaled
// `now()`; only the scheduler touches the real clock.
/**
 * The workflow scheduler (Epic 27 §The scheduler service) — the clock-based peer to the event
 * reactor (`t3work-workflowEngineReactor.ts`). Where the reactor wakes a run parked on
 * `askUser` / `askAgent` when a domain event lands, the scheduler wakes a run parked on
 * `waitUntil` when the wall clock reaches its deadline.
 *
 * It owns the durable wake deadlines: `workflow_runs` rows in status `sleeping` carry a
 * `wake_at` instant and the `waitUntil` correlation they parked on. The scheduler indexes that
 * set into ONE process timer armed for the SOONEST `wake_at`; on fire it resumes every due run
 * by appending its `waitUntil` reply — the exact `registry.getRun(runId).resume(...)` path the
 * reactor uses, just clock-triggered — then re-arms for the next deadline.
 *
 * ── Durability ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The timer lives only in memory, but the deadlines live in the DB. On boot
 * (`rehydrateSuspendedWorkflowRuns`, after it rebuilds each sleeping run's resume closure)
 * {@link WorkflowScheduler.rearm} re-reads the sleeping set and re-arms. A deadline that PASSED
 * during downtime computes a non-negative delay of 0 and fires immediately (catch-up). As runs
 * park or wake at runtime, the lifecycle pokes `rearm` so the soonest-deadline timer stays
 * current.
 *
 * Single-instance only (Epic 27 §Open question 4): no lease/leader, so this assumes one server
 * owns the sleeping rows. A replicated deployment would wake a run once per instance.
 *
 * The scheduler is the only clock authority for waking runs: workflow bodies read the journaled
 * `now()` for timing decisions; the scheduler reads the real clock and pokes the engine, which
 * keeps replay deterministic while still being time-driven.
