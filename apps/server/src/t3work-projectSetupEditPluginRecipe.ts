Write the updated source into the draft artifact path the workflow provides, then reply briefly that the draft is ready.

<!-- Split into ./prompts/edit-recipe.md and ./prompts/edit-section.md if the per-kind guidance needs to diverge further. -->

## shared

- Edit only the single target file.
- Preserve exports, ids, and existing structure unless the request explicitly changes them.
- Keep nearby formatting and relative imports consistent.

## bundled-recipe

- Keep the file authored as createBundledRecipe({ ... kickoff }) when it already uses that shape.
- Do not migrate the file to defineRecipe or another SDK wrapper.
- Preserve recipe ids, surfaces, allowed tool groups, and kickoff structure unless the request changes them.

## recipe-module

- Preserve stable recipe ids, workflow contracts, and referenced file paths unless the change requires them.
- Keep compatibility with existing prompt, workflow, and helper modules.

## section-module

- Preserve section ids, item ids, and menu wiring unless the request explicitly changes them.
- Keep the existing shell and sidecar behavior intact.

## recipe-manifest

- Keep valid JSON.
- Preserve relative prompt, workflow, and helper paths unless the request changes them.

## generic-module

- Make the smallest coherent change that satisfies the request.
