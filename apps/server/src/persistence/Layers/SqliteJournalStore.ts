/**
 * SqliteJournalStore — the SDK {@link JournalStore} seam, backed by the `workflow_journal`
 * table (Epic 25 §Open question 2).
 *
 * Each journal entry is stored as one row holding the *exact* wire object the fs backend
 * writes as a line (`toWire` / `toResolvedWire`), so {@link buildJournalMaps} reconstructs the
 * identical replay maps the engine expects — every 25.2/25.4 semantic (the void/value
 * envelope, schema re-validation on replay, drift detection, the `sent`/`resolved` split)
 * rides along unchanged. One row per entry means a torn tail is impossible (N/A), so there is
 * no torn-tail recovery here. Run metadata is the `phase='meta'` row at seq -1.
 *
 * The SDK engine is Promise-based, so this bridges Effect → Promise: `sql` is captured once
 * (its statements are `R = never`), and each method runs via `Effect.runPromise`. The
 * `createStoreSink` adapter in the SDK sequences a run's appends on a single tail promise and
 * awaits a `flush()` barrier at the suspend/complete boundary, so rows are durable before the
 * host parks or completes a run.
