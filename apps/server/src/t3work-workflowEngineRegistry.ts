/**
 * In-memory registry for live workflow-engine runs (Epic 25 §Host wiring). A run that fires
 * an ask verb (`thread.turn` / `user.input`) durably suspends; the host parks it and resumes
 * it when the reply lands. This registry is the park lot:
 *
 *   • `runs` maps a runId → its `resume(correlationId, reply)` closure (created by the launch,
 *     which captures the workflow ref + run options so a resume re-runs `resumeWorkflow`).
 *   • `pendingByThread` maps a threadId → the ask currently awaiting a reply on that thread.
 *     The broker records it when it fires an ask; the reactor reads it when a turn completes
 *     or the user replies, then calls the run's `resume`.
 *
 * State is process-local, but it is no longer the source of truth: it is a hot index rebuilt
 * at boot from the durable `workflow_runs` table (Epic 25 §Open question 2 — DB-backed
 * durability). The launch + broker write the run record + pending ask through to SQLite, and
 * `rehydrateSuspendedWorkflowRuns` re-registers every suspended run here on startup, so a run
 * parked on a multi-hour ask survives a restart. A run is suspended on at most one ask per
 * thread at a time, so a single `pendingByThread` slot per thread is sufficient.
