/**
 * Launch-preview emission for the play-as-shape view (recipe-UX design pass). When a recipe's
 * `.workflow.ts` is launched, the host derives its read-only shape (SDK `deriveWorkflowShape` —
 * a static AST scan, no body execution) and posts it to the launching thread as a system message
 * carrying the `t3work.workflow.shape` view, so the user sees the plan before/while it runs. This
 * mirrors the broker's decision-card emission ({@link ./t3work-workflowEngineBroker.ts}); it is
 * best-effort — the caller reads the source (returning early when it can't), and a derivation
 * failure or an empty shape returns null here, so neither ever blocks the launch.
