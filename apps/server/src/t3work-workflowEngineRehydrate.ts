/**
 * Boot rehydration for durable workflow runs (Epic 25 §Open question 2).
 *
 * On startup — after the orchestration reactors are live, before the welcome event — every
 * `workflow_runs` row in status `suspended` is rebuilt into a live, resumable run:
 *   • DATA from the DB — workflow path, launch args, project/model/mode, and the pending ask —
 *     is read off the row.
 *   • CODE from the host layers — the orchestration `dispatch`, the SQLite journal store, the
 *     in-memory registry, the lifecycle write-through — is reconstructed here and handed to
 *     {@link createWorkflowRunController}, the SAME builder the live launch uses.
 * The controller re-registers the run's `resume` closure; restoring the pending ask into the
 * in-memory registry then makes the reactor behave identically whether the ask was set this
 * uptime or recovered from a prior one. No local-disk journal is involved — replay reads the
 * DB-backed journal through the injected store.
 *
 * ── Clock-parked runs (Epic 27) ──────────────────────────────────────────────
 * A run parked on `waitUntil` is in status `sleeping`, not `suspended`. It rebuilds the same
 * resume closure (so the scheduler can drive it forward), but is woken by the CLOCK, not an
 * event — so it does NOT restore a reactor pending ask; instead the scheduler re-arms its
 * `wake_at`. A deadline that passed during downtime fires immediately on the first arm. The
 * rebuilt lifecycle's `onSleep` re-pokes the scheduler so a run that sleeps again keeps the
 * soonest-deadline timer current.
 *
 * Single-instance only (Epic 25 §Out of scope): no lease/lock, so this assumes one server owns
 * these rows. A row whose pending ask is missing is logged and skipped (it cannot be resolved).
