/**
 * Single-launch guard for recipe workflows.
 *
 * One Quick Start "send" can reach `backend.launchRecipeWorkflow` from two independent web
 * paths for the same thread: the eager thread-bootstrap kickoff
 * ({@link import("./t3work-runThreadBootstrapKickoff").runThreadBootstrapKickoff}) and the
 * composer's turn-start override
 * ({@link import("./t3work-recipeWorkflowLaunch").launchPendingRecipeWorkflowTurn}). Without a
 * guard both fire and the durable engine spawns two runs for one click. Each path claims the
 * launch thread synchronously before dispatching; the first claim wins, the second no-ops.
 *
 * A recipe launch always opens a fresh thread, so a per-thread claim is launch-once by
 * construction and never needs releasing.
