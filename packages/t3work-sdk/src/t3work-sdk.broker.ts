/**
 * The message-broker seam (Epic 25 §The thread model — host wiring). The engine does NOT
 * deliver messages — the host does. A thread verb's `sent` entry fires `broker.send(envelope,
 * resolver)`; the host routes the envelope into orchestration and, when a reply lands, settles
 * it. Two settlement paths:
 *
 *   • Synchronous — the broker calls `resolver.resolve(reply)` inside `send`. The runtime
 *     appends the `resolved` journal entry immediately, so the same run sees the reply and
 *     never suspends. (This is what the mock broker uses, and what an in-process recipient
 *     would do.)
 *   • Out of band — the broker returns without resolving; the run suspends. When the reply
 *     arrives later (a turn completes, or the user posts a message) the host calls
 *     {@link appendResolvedEntry} to write the `resolved` line, then `resumeWorkflow`, which
 *     replays to the same `await` and finds it.
 *
 * The four thread verbs map onto orchestration: `thread.create` → dispatch(thread.create),
 * `thread.turn` → dispatch(thread.turn.start) (resolves on turn-done), `thread.message` →
 * dispatch(thread.message.upsert) (one-way), `user.input` → a system message requesting input
 * (resolves on the user's reply). One-way verbs never settle a resolver.
