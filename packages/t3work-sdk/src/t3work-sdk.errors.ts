/**
 * Workflow-engine error taxonomy (Epic 25 §Error classes).
 *
 * Every primitive failure the engine raises is classified into exactly one of these
 * classes so workflow authors can branch with `instanceof`. The base {@link WorkflowError}
 * is injected into the workflow body as a global (see t3work-sdk.workflowGlobals.ts); the
 * subclasses are injected alongside it so author code that references e.g.
 * `PermissionDeniedError` resolves the identifier.
 *
 * Phase 25.2 only *throws* a subset of these (replay divergence, load-time refusal,
 * journal corruption). The remaining subclasses are declared here so the taxonomy is
 * complete and stable; the primitives that raise them land in 25.3–25.5.
 *
 * The taxonomy is `class` declarations (not a generic factory) so that `instanceof
 * <ErrorSubclass>` works inside workflow bodies — the spec's catchable-error contract
 * depends on the class identity being a real, named class.
