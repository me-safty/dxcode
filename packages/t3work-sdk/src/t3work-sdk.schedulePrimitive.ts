/**
 * The `waitUntil` body primitive (Epic 27 §waitUntil) — the clock-driven sibling of `wait`.
 *
 * A durable suspension fired through the broker exactly like an ask verb: a `sent` entry
 * carrying the deadline parks the run (→ `WorkflowSuspended` → `SuspendedResult`); its
 * `resolved` reply is appended later — by the scheduler when the wall clock reaches the
 * deadline, NOT by an event. The deadline rides in the `sent` entry's args, so the argsHash
 * drift guard enforces that `when` re-derives identically on replay (it must come from the
 * journaled `now()`, never the live clock). The host's broker records the deadline as the run's
 * `wake_at` so the scheduler can arm a timer; on resume the recorded reply settles the await.
 *
 * Split out of the Thread-model primitives because it is not a thread verb (no thread, no
 * recipient) — it is a scheduling primitive, and keeping it here holds the dense thread module
 * under the additive-guard LOC ceiling.
