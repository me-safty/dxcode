/**
 * End-to-end Thread-model test (Epic 25 acceptance). One recipe body runs an isolated-thread
 * `agent(..., { schema })`, a launching-thread `thread.askAgent(..., { schema })`, and a
 * launching-thread `thread.askUser(..., { schema })`. A broker that always defers makes each
 * ask suspend; the test then plays the production reactor's role — `appendResolvedEntry` +
 * `resumeWorkflow` for each pending correlationId in turn — until the run completes with all
 * three replies validated against their schemas.
 *
 * This is the suspend→resume loop the real `WorkflowEngineReactor` drives off `turn-done` /
 * user-reply events; here the replies are canned so the whole pipeline is deterministic.
