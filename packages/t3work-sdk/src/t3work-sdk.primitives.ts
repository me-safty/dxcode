/**
 * The composition workflow-body primitives bound as globals: the black-boxed `parallel` /
 * `pipeline` / `workflow`, the durable timer `wait`, the `budget` accumulator, and the
 * cosmetic `phase` / `log`. (The LLM verb `agent` lives in `t3work-sdk.threadPrimitives.ts`
 * now — it is `spawnThread().askAgent()` and routes through the Handle/broker seam, not a
 * separate dispatcher.)
 *
 * Every primitive that produces durable state routes through the runtime's generic
 * `callPrimitive` seat, so replay returns the recorded result without re-sleeping or
 * re-running a sub-workflow. The composition primitives run their thunks inside
 * `runBlackBoxed` so the calls inside them are NOT individually journaled — the composition
 * primitive is the journal boundary (a documented Stage-1 tradeoff).
