/**
 * Thread-model tests (Epic 25 §The thread model). Every verb reduces to a `sent`/`resolved`
 * pair on the Handle dispatch:
 *   1. agent one-shot   — `agent(p)` + `agent(p,{schema})` = spawnThread().askAgent(); two
 *                          thread.create + thread.turn pairs, replays without re-firing.
 *   2. spawned thread    — spawnThread + askAgent(schema) + notifyAgent follow-up; the message
 *                          targets the spawned thread's id.
 *   3. suspend/resume    — thread.askUser, broker defers → SuspendedResult; appendResolvedEntry
 *                          + resumeWorkflow → completes with the validated reply.
 *   4. fire-and-forget   — spawnThread + notifyAgent + notifyUser record only sent entries.
 *   5. capability gate   — askUser without "user" → PermissionDeniedError, broker untouched.
 *   6. determinism       — the same body replays to the same correlationId.
 *   7. schema retry      — an ask whose replies never satisfy the schema → SchemaExhaustedError.
