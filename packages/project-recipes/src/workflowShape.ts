/**
 * The `workflow.shape` view contract (play-as-shape view, recipe-UX design pass). A read-only
 * descriptor of WHAT A RECIPE WILL DO — its phase strip plus an ordered, kind-tagged step list
 * — derived statically from the `.workflow.ts` (SDK `deriveWorkflowShape`). The launch path
 * attaches it to a system message (`t3workExt.attachments`, kind `"view"`); the web renders it
 * as the in-thread "plan" card (distinct from the `askUser` decision card; see
 * {@link ./workflowDecision.ts}). This schema is the host/web validation boundary for the
 * payload — the SDK `WorkflowStepKind`/`WorkflowShape` types mirror it and extend in lockstep.
