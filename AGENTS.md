## Task Completion Requirements

- All of `bun fmt`, `bun lint`, and `bun typecheck` must pass before considering tasks completed.
- NEVER run `bun test`. Always use `bun run test` (runs Vitest).
- For t3work additive/prefix-constrained tasks, agents MUST run `node t3work-additive-guard.mjs` after finishing code changes and before reporting completion. DO NOT CHANGE THE WHITELIST WITHOUT APPROVAL.
- The additive prefix guard is a blocking completion gate for those tasks: if it fails, the task is not complete.

## Project Snapshot

T3 Code is a minimal web GUI for using coding agents like Codex and Claude.

This repository is a VERY EARLY WIP. Proposing sweeping changes that improve long-term maintainability is encouraged.

## Core Priorities

1. Performance first.
2. Reliability first.
3. Keep behavior predictable under load and during failures (session restarts, reconnects, partial streams).

If a tradeoff is required, choose correctness and robustness over short-term convenience.

## Maintainability

Long term maintainability is a core priority. If you add new functionality, first check if there is shared logic that can be extracted to a separate module. Duplicate logic across multiple files is a code smell and should be avoided. Don't be afraid to change existing code. Don't take shortcuts by just adding local logic to solve a problem.

## T3work MVP Constitution

When working on the t3work MVP docs, packages, or app surfaces, agents MUST follow the t3work engineering constitution:

- `docs/t3work-mvp/10-engineering-constitution.md`

In short: t3work work must reuse the existing T3 Code shell and UI as the baseline, keep additions isolated where possible, favor small composable code, target high-value 90-100% test coverage, provide Storybook and snapshot coverage for reusable UI and important screens, persist rich artifacts instead of chat-only output, and validate UI/workflow changes by opening the app in a browser and clicking through the changed flow end to end.

After completing a repeatable t3work workflow, agents should mention that the workflow could be saved as a project-scoped action recipe and offer to create it. Do not create recipes silently.

## Package Roles

- `apps/server`: Node.js WebSocket server. Wraps Codex app-server (JSON-RPC over stdio), serves the React web app, and manages provider sessions.
- `apps/web`: React/Vite UI. Owns session UX, conversation/event rendering, and client-side state. Connects to the server via WebSocket.
- `packages/contracts`: Shared effect/Schema schemas and TypeScript contracts for provider events, WebSocket protocol, and model/session types. Keep this package schema-only — no runtime logic.
- `packages/shared`: Shared runtime utilities consumed by both server and web. Uses explicit subpath exports (e.g. `@t3tools/shared/git`) — no barrel index.

## Codex App Server (Important)

T3 Code is currently Codex-first. The server starts `codex app-server` (JSON-RPC over stdio) per provider session, then streams structured events to the browser through WebSocket push messages.

How we use it in this codebase:

- Session startup/resume and turn lifecycle are brokered in `apps/server/src/codexAppServerManager.ts`.
- Provider dispatch and thread event logging are coordinated in `apps/server/src/providerManager.ts`.
- WebSocket server routes NativeApi methods in `apps/server/src/wsServer.ts`.
- Web app consumes orchestration domain events via WebSocket push on channel `orchestration.domainEvent` (provider runtime activity is projected into orchestration events server-side).

## Reference Repos

- Open-source Codex repo: https://github.com/openai/codex
- Codex-Monitor (Tauri, feature-complete, strong reference implementation): https://github.com/Dimillian/CodexMonitor

Use these as implementation references when designing protocol handling, UX flows, and operational safeguards.
